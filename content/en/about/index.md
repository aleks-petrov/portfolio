I've always been fascinated by the energy industry and markets in general. I've gained professional experience in the transportation logistics industry, the upstream oil & gas industry, and the energy commodities industry. In my educational career, I've had the privelege to take courses in statistics and econometrics, finance, accounting, and the energy sector. Additionally, I've been able to get involved in campus activities like rugby and explore my interests in an international context during a year abroad. I now hope to pursue a career and add value in the commodities industry, which I believe is at the intersection of all my interests and skills gained so far.
